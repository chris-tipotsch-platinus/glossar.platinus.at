# Portfolio

Nach ITILv4 ist eine Portfolio: *"A collection of assets into which an organization chooses to invest its resources in order to receive the best return."*

Portfolio management encompasses several portfolios, including:

1. **Customer portfolio**: Reflects the organization’s commitment to serving certain service consumer
   groups and market spaces. It might influence the structure and content of the product and
   service portfolio and the project portfolio. The customer portfolio is used to ensure that the
   relationship between business outcomes, customers, and services is well understood. 
2. **Product and service portfolio**: The complete set of products and services that are managed by
   the organization, representing the organization’s commitments and investments across all of its
   customers and market spaces. It also represents current contractual commitments, new product
   and service development, and ongoing improvement plans.

1. **Programme and project portfolio**: Used to manage and coordinate projects, ensuring that
   objectives are met within time and cost constraints and to their specifications. The project
   portfolio also ensures that projects are not duplicated and stay within the agreed scope, and
   that resources are available for each project. It is used to manage single projects as well as
   large-scale programmes. It supports organization’s product and service portfolio and
   improvements to the organization’s practices and service value system (SVS).
