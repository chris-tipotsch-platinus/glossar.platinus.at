# Rightshifting

After achieving some basic level of *awareness* would some people seek to take *responsibility* for their situation and then, maybe, *commit* to doing something about it.  (ARC – Awareness; Responsibility; Commitment – from Sir John Whitmore’s Coaching For Performance).

**The Dreyfus Model** (of Skill Acquisition) may be familiar to the Agile Coaches and ScrumMasters amongst you. This model was the inspiration – in term of structure, at least – for the **Marshall Model**. 

## Seven stages of organisational evolution

The Marshall Model proposes some **seven stages of organisational evolution**. Each stage signifying notably more effectiveness, relative to the prior stage. Here’s the seven stages, with some characteristics that organisations typically exhibit at each stage:

1.  **Ad-hoc**
   1.  making it up as they go along.
   2.  repeatedly solving the same or similar problems.
   3.  unconscious incompetence.
2.  **Novice Analytical**
   1.  rigid adherence to rules.
   2.  little or no discretionary judgement.
   3.  potential to fall back to ad-hoc thinking.
   4.  unconscious incompetence.
3.  **Competent Analytical**
   1.  situational perception still unwittingly focussed on local optima.
   2.  all areas of the business are treated separately and given equalencouragement to improve.
   3.  results across the organisation and through time vary widely interms of quality and predictability.
   4.  unconscious incompetence.
4.  **Early Synergistic**
   1.  coping with complexity (multiple concurrent stakeholders, needs).
   2.  action now partially seen as part of longer-term systemic goals.
   3.  conscious, deliberate consideration of the organisation as a system.
   4.  potential for reversion to Analytical thinking.
   5.  reduction in variability of results.
   6.  conscious incompetence.
5.  **Mature Synergistic**
   1.  holistic view of situations, rather than fractured and faceted.
   2.  awareness of constraints, system throughput and capabilities.
   3.  appreciation for what is truly valuable (to customers, otherstakeholders).
   4.  can distinguish between common and special causes of variation.
   5.  streamlined decision-making, often evidence-base.
   6.  uses maxims for guidance; meaning of maxims may vary according to context.
   7.  results routinely fully acceptable.
   8.  conscious competence.
6.  **Early Chaordic**
   1.  no longer reliant on rules, guidelines, maxims.
   2.  intuitive grasp of situations, based on deep tacit understanding.
   3.  driven by vision of what is possible.
   4.  can integrate new idea, approaches, technologies with ease.
   5.  conscious competence.
7.  **Proficient Chaordic**
   1.  knowledge of the evidence base and underlying knowledge in entirety.
   2.  can teach chaordic mindset to new starters, partners in the extended supply chain.
   3.  can use the knowledge interlinked with other knowledge.
   4.  excellence achieved with relative ease.
   5.  intuitively responds to unusual situations.
   6.  results regularly delight and surprise.
   7.  unconscious or reflective competence.
